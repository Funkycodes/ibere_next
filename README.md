# Ibere - The beginning

> This repo contains our nextjs starter. It uses in addition to nextjs the following technologies- 
- Gsap
- Sass, Sass modules
- Lenis by [@studio-freight](https://github.com/studio-freight)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load google fonts.

## Special Directories
